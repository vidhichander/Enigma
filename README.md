# Enigma
Encryption software similar to the one used by the Germans in World War II. Implemented rotors, pawls, and reflectors in the program, and collectively used them to create permutations for a progressive substitution cipher that can encode and decode strings of characters.

**I did not write the entirety of this code. Some parts were written by the staff of CS61B at University of California, Berkeley.**
